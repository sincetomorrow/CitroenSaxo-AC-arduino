*Parts List*

* Arduino Pro mini 3.3V
* OLED 0.96''
* BME280 sensors (x2)
* Rotary encoder
* Relay Switch 3.3V

I have also included the stl file. You have to remove two buttons and clip it after you assemble it. I have replaced the AC button which was already broken and a placeholder slot next to it.
